${step.description}
</CurrentStep>

<StepIndex>
Current Step Index: ${stepIndex + 1} out of ${steps.length} steps.

If a login screen appears, use:

- Password: ${auth.password}

<Instructions>
- Look at the current screenshot before acting. If the page is still loading, use the wait action.
- Perform only the current step. Stop as soon as the expected result is visible in the screenshot.
- If the step fails or produces a validation error, correct the input and retry once.
- Do not navigate to a new URL unless the step description explicitly says to.
- Keep individual action batches small so the screenshot loop can verify progress.
